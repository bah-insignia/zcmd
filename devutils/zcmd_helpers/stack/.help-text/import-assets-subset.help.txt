                   that we want to 'rsync' into our local website.  The format
                   of FOLDERSUFFIX is generally as follows ...

EXAMPLES
--------
Pick from a list ...

    zcmd import-assets --pick-from-list

Import the assets from the STAGE asset backup ...

    zcmd import-assets stage-html

Import the assets from the PROD asset backup ...

    zcmd import-assets prod-html

NOTE
----
The source of all the backups is the SHARED_S3_STAGING_BUCKET_NAME S3 bucket and the 
script knows what project to pull from based on the PROJECT_NAME value
in the stack.env file.

The backups themselves are created using the web-utils on the source servers.
