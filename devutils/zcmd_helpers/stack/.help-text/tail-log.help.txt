PURPOSE
-------
Tails the apache log 

SYNTAX
------
zcmd tail-log [NUMBER_OF_LINES]

REQUIREMENTS
------------
The command assumes your webserver container is writing log files
into the /var/log/apache2/error.log path.  If your webserver apache 
log is in a different path, set the WEB_INTERNAL_PATH_ERROR_LOG variable
in your stack.env to what it is for you.

NOTE
----
The command tries to guess at your container name, but you can 
provide a name by setting the CONTAINER_NAME_WEB variable in stack.env
