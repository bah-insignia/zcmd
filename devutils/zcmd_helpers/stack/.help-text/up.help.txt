PURPOSE
-------
Fire up the docker stack defined by the current directory.

SYNTAX
------
zcmd up [ENVIRONMENT_CONTEXT] [COMPOSE_CMDARGS]

Where ...

ENVIRONMENT_CONTEXT = Optional override of the default value (e.g., pass PROD
                      or STAGE as the value to override your default DEV value.)

                      NOTE: To see if your stack supports different configurations
                            by ENVIRONMENT_CONTEXT, look for that name in the
                            docker-compose.yml of your stack.

COMPOSE_CMDARGS     = Optional support for passing some docker-compose command
                      line arguments.
