PURPOSE
-------
Create a container and open a terminal into it of the machine
defined in the current folder.

The user in the terminal will be 'root' regardless whatever default
user is declared in the machine image.

Use this command when testing a new machine image from a command terminal 
and you are sure you want to go into the terminal as root.

SYNTAX
------
zcmd run-as-root [IMAGE_NAME [TAGNAME]]

    IMAGE_NAME = Optional image name, uses name from machine.env if not specified.
    TAGNAME    = Optional, assumes 'latest' if not specified.

NOTE
----
Tries running local image first, then tries remote image if local failed.
Default image name, and port mappings (if any), come from machine.env
