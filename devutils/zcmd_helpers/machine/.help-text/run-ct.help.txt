PURPOSE
-------
Create a container and open a terminal into it of the machine
defined in the current folder.

Use this command when testing a new machine image from a command terminal.

SYNTAX
------
zcmd run=ct [IMAGE_NAME [TAGNAME]]

    USER_NAME  = Optional user name for terminal user.
    IMAGE_NAME = Optional image name, uses name from machine.env if not specified.
    TAGNAME    = Optional, assumes 'latest' if not specified.

NOTES
-----
Tries running local image first, then tries remote image if local failed.
Default image name, and port mappings (if any), come from machine.env

You can pass the string "DEFAULT" as an explicit command for the script to use
the default value in place of that argument.

EXAMPLE
-------
The following example will run the image defined in machine.env as the default
user for that image using tag value "20190728.1".

    zmcd run DEFAULT DEFAULT 20190728.1
