Overview
========
The ZCMD framework was created by Frank Font in 2017 with signficant early brainstorming with Jay Stuart and much practical hands-on real-world feedback and debugging with Chris Desautels, Krishna Kossery, and Eric Walton.  Chris Desautels in particular has jumped in and made it better through feedback and in some cases adding extensions himself.

The framework was released open-source in 2019.
